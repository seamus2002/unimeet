# HOW TO RUN

After you cd into the correct folder,

instead of running " npm install " make sure you run " npm install react-router-dom "

from there, you can just do " npm run dev "


to fix pulling error, you can run this command instead of stashing 

git reset --hard HEAD

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
